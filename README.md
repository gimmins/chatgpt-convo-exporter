# ChatGPT Conversation Exporter

A simple widget/tool that helps you export entire ChatGPT conversations into a plain text file for easy archiving, sharing, or reference.

## 🚀 What it does

This tool:

- Collects all visible messages from a ChatGPT thread
- Formats them cleanly into a text format
- Lets you download the conversation as a `.txt` file

✅ No more manual copy-pasting block by block  
✅ Great for saving study sessions, code reviews, brainstorms, or interview prep logs

## 💡 Why I built this

I often found it frustrating to save long ChatGPT conversations, especially when the UI made copying tricky. This tool solves that pain point for myself and others who want to archive or review their AI interactions.
